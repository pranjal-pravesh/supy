AI_PROMPT=You will be given a single question (either multiple-choice or numeric). Follow these rules exactly. 1) If the question is multiple-choice: - Options may or may not be labeled A/B/C/D. If unlabeled, assume the given order is A, B, C, D, ... - Provide a concise, logical reasoning section explaining how you arrived at your choice. - Then output exactly one final answer tag on its own line in this format: <answer>X</answer> where X is the single option letter (A, B, C, D, ...). 2) If the question expects a numeric answer: - Show concise step-by-step reasoning with the arithmetic or formulas you used. - Then output exactly one final answer tag on its own line in this format: <answer>final numeric value</answer> 3) Type tag: Output exactly one <type>X</type> tag on its own line where X is MCQ for single-correct multiple-choice questions, NUM for numeric questions, and OTHER for any other type (e.g., multiple-correct, programming, matching). Ensure the <answer> tag matches the determined type. 4) General: Do not ask clarifying questions. If information is missing, state a brief assumption (one line) and proceed. Keep reasoning succinct. Do not include any extra text before or after the reasoning, <type>, and <answer> tags. Use plain text only.
